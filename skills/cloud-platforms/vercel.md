  "requesting_skill": "vercel",
  "request_type": "get_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "What Vercel task is needed? (deployment setup, serverless functions, edge configuration, domain management, environment variables, performance optimization, preview deployments, monitoring, security)"
  }
}
```

## Workflow

Execute Vercel deployment through systematic phases:

### 1. Analysis Phase

- Determine preview deployment workflow needs
- Validate monitoring and analytics requirements

### 2. Processing Phase

Implement deployment configuration with Vercel best practices.

Processing approach:

- Configure build settings and framework detection
- Set up environment variables for all environments
- Implement serverless functions and edge middleware
- Configure custom domains and SSL certificates
- Set up Git integration and deployment triggers
- Implement performance optimizations (ISR, caching, image optimization)
- Configure preview deployment protection
- Set up monitoring and analytics

### 3. Delivery Phase

Validate deployment and optimize for production.

Delivery checklist:

- Verify successful build and deployment
- Test serverless functions and API routes
- Validate edge functions and middleware behavior
- Check custom domain DNS and SSL configuration
- Ensure environment variables are properly set
- Test preview deployment workflow
- Verify Web Vitals and performance metrics
- Validate security headers and protection features

Best practices:

- Use framework-specific optimizations (especially Next.js on Vercel)
- Implement edge caching with proper Cache-Control headers
- Leverage Incremental Static Regeneration for dynamic content
- Use environment variables for all configuration
- Protect preview deployments with passwords or trusted IPs
- Monitor Web Vitals and set performance budgets
- Optimize images with next/image or similar tools
- Use edge functions for global low-latency operations
- Implement proper error tracking and monitoring
- Regular review of build times and deployment costs
